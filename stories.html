						<h3>Ben</h3>

						After several months of training, Ben's teacher praised him for
						his learning abilities at school. Exercise and eating healthy has
						helped to improve Ben's concentration in class. Counting his reps
						while training also helped with his math’s scores! Even though he
						skips to the last rep count sometimes. Ben has loss body and can
					  now fit into his school uniform again. We are supper proud of
						Ben and we love training him.

						6 months in training with Sam and Danielle, I'm heading into my 40th
						 birthday feeling healthy & strong - which was a massive goal of
						 mine after some ill health last year. Exercise, healthy eating,
						 rest and a positive outlook have all played a part. And these guy
						 have helped out in all these areas.

						Antidepressants were my savior for almost 8 years, until I started
						exercising with Smile and Move. I am now off antidepressants
						completely and my mental state has improved incredibly and I am so
						greatful. Feeling as good as I do from just exercising is amazing.
						Thanks so much!

						When I first started seeing you Sam, as you know, lower back was a
						big issue. The training with you and a combination of a treatment
						from a friend of ours Matt Baker. My lower back pain is on an
						increase. I’d wake up in the middle of the night with back pain
						where I’d have to get out of bed and move around for half an
						hour and stretch in order to go back to sleep. And that’s how bad
						it was. The routine that you’ve designed for me with the glutes, the
						hamstrings, the hip flexors, core stability, all of that stuff and
						couple of stretching but in particular those strengthening
						exercises has helped my lower back pain enormously. I’m getting
						much freer there, my lower back pain disappearing slowly but
						surely. As long as I keep training and keep doing the things
						that we’re working on.

						<h3>Corey</h3>

					<p>
						Corey found it hard to gain muscles and strength training alone
						until us. Corey gain 6kgs in 5 months of training. Ben has also
						achived similar goals gaining whooping 9kgs in 3 months.
