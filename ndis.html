			    We are one of a few NDIS registered trainer in Ipswich. Ever since taking on Ben we have found a passion working with disabled. A previous struggle for Ben was to find a gym or personal trainer who would accept him due to his disability. This is highly unfair and can not only affect their physical and mental health, but also their participation in education, and social activities. At Smile and Move our number one aim is to provide a positive and happy environment for all fitness standards, and to treat every individual equally weather they have a disability or not.

					<h3>Ben's Story</h3>
					<p>
						Ben's teacher praised him for his learning abilities at school. Exercise and eating healthy has helped to improve Ben's concentration in class. Counting his reps while training also helped with his maths scores! Even though he skips to the last rep count sometimes!
